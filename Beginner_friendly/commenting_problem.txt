Uncommenting the dependency
----------------------------


step 1:Reload Maven project: After making changes to pom.xml,
        reload the Maven project in your IDE (usually, a right-click on the project
          and selecting "Maven -> Reload project"). 

step 2:Rebuild your project: Run mvn clean install to ensure everything compiles successfully.

step 3:Run your Spring Boot application: Once the dependency is available,
          your application should start correctly and serve web content.
